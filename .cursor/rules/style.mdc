# TypeScript Style Rules

- Prefer explicit function signatures for exported/public APIs; avoid `any`.
- Use descriptive names: functions as verbs, variables as nouns; avoid 1–2 char names.
- Use early returns and handle error/edge cases first; avoid deep nesting.
- Keep comments short and explain "why"; avoid trivial comments.
- Match existing formatting; do not reformat unrelated code.
- For partial updates, prefer small helpers (e.g., `assignDefined`).
