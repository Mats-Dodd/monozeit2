# Operational Guardrails

- Never perform git operations unless explicitly told to
- Prefer absolute paths in tool calls (workspace is `/Users/matthewdodd/Documents/projects/stones`).
- When running commands, assume non-interactive flags and avoid pagers.
- Do not introduce or modify unrelated files; keep edits scoped.
